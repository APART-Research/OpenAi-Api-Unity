# OpenAi Api Unity
A Simple OpenAi API wrapper for Unity. 

## Quick Start
This wrapper has been designed to follow the [OpenAI API Reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference) as closely as possible in syntax. 

Save your [Secret API Key](https://beta.openai.com/docs/developer-quickstart) as the file `~/.openai/key.txt` (Linux/Mac) or `%USERPROFILE%/.openai/key.txt` (Windows)

TO DO: Add the mono behviour

TO DO: Make a call to the api


## Docs

### Authentication
The OpenAi Api is currently in beta and requires special access to use it. You can [Sign Up for Access](https://openai.com/)

Access to the API is managed using your [Secret API Key](https://beta.openai.com/docs/developer-quickstart)

You have two options to authenticate the api in Unity. 
  1. Copy/Paste in Scriptable Object (Not recommended for projects commited to public repos, as this will reveal your key to the public)
  2. Save in `key.txt` file

TO DO: Sort this out in the library
